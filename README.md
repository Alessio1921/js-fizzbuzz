In this exercise I created a grid that has 101 cells, each of them are printed with their index number in the middle of them using a for loop.
If a cell is a multiple of 3, it's color will be green and "fizz" will be printed inside of it.
If a cell is a multiple of 5, it's color will be black and "buzz" will be printed inside of it.
If a cell is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it's color will be red and "fizzbuzz" will be printed inside of it.
